## Description

The Dark Venus MT5 Expert Advisor is a high win scalping expert advisor designed to trade on the MetaTrader 5 platform. It uses Bollinger Bands as a technical indicator to identify potential buy and sell signals.

- BollingerPeriod: The period used for calculating the Bollinger Bands (default: 20)

## Trade Function

The trade function is responsible for executing the trading logic based on the Bollinger Bands indicator.

1. It calculates the upper and lower Bollinger Bands using the specified period and deviation.
2. It checks if the price crosses above the upper band. If it does, a buy order is opened with the specified stop loss and take profit levels.
